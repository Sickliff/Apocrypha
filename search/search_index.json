It consists of enchanting custom Fortify Alchemy gear, using it to create a Fortify Enchanting potion, and making stronger Fortify Alchemy gear with that potion to repeat the process. In practice this is the slowest alchemy loop, but it can still be used to create potions strong enough to crash the game.</p> <p>For the optimal conditions of this bug, you'll need to complete a rather lengthy setup. First, make sure your Alchemy and Enchanting skills are maxed out. You'll then want to collect and clear the Sallow Regent Black Book for access to the Seeker of Sorcery and Seeker of Shadows powers. You should also gain ownership of Severin Manor for easy access to enchanting and alchemy tables, and the ability to enter the Black Book. Additionally, exactly four pieces of Ahzidal's armor are required for the Ahzidal's Genius effect (Ahzidal's Genius will not be conferred if wearing more than 4 pieces).</p> <p>You'll need an ample supply of: * Grand Soul Gems * Fortify Enchanting alchemy ingredients     * Stoneflower Petals or Dreugh Wax would be ideal due to their 2x strength * Unenchanted armor     * Penitus Oculatus Helmets or Falmer Helmets (These headgear can be worn together with a circlet).     * Circlets     * Necklaces     * Rings     * Bracers</p> <p>Once you have everything, use the following steps to perform the loop. - Use The Sallow Regent to gain Seeker of Sorcery, and equip 4 pieces of Ahzidal's Armor - Drink your Fortify Enchanting potion (If you're at the start of the loop you can use an Enchanter's Elixir, or ignore this part), then enchant a full set (Necklace, Ring, Bracers, and both Headgear) of Fortify Alchemy Gear - Use The Sallow Regent to gain Seeker of Shadows, then equip your Fortify Alchemy Gear - Brew a Fortify Enchanting potion and return to step 1</p> <p>This may take some time, in part due to the loading screens needed to access the Black Book.

For example, a character at level 2 that used their level-up to increase their base health would need a Ravage Health effect of at least 110 strength. In other words, the Ravage Health effect would have to be enough to kill you without Fortify Health, but not enough to kill you with your Fortify Health enchantment/potion effect.</p> <p>Unlike most alchemy effects, Ravage Health can stack with itself additively if multiple potions are consumed. This means that you can reach the required level of Ravage Health by drinking many weaker potions, or simply by eating many Scathecraw or Congealed Putrescence since they have Ravage Health as their first effect. Other magic effects that reduce health such as Neloth's Health Boost and the Cursed Lord's Mail can contribute to the Ravage Health threshold.</p> <p>The Fortify Health effect used can be of any strength as long as you still have health remaining after applying the Ravage Health effects. The Fortify Health effect must be applied before the Ravage Health effects. Once both effects are applied, you should not die.
